# Titanic Project

"The data for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle's 'Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster' competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

The analysis was conducted in five parts:

#1. Statistical Tests:
A statistical analysis of the data involved obtaining p-values and drawing conclusions. Calculations were performed to gather information and address specific questions.

2. Cleaning for Machine Learning:
The data underwent cleaning and transformation into numerical format. The processed data was then exported for the subsequent step.

3. Machine Learning for Age Regression:
Machine Learning for Age Regression: Various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest Regression (yielding the best results), Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression, were employed to predict ages.

4. Machine Learning for Survival Prediction (Classification):
Several machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression (using a probabilistic approach and achieving the best results), Extreme Tree Classification, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), were utilized to predict survival outcomes.

5. Machine Learning Unsupervised Analysis:
K-means clustering was employed for an unsupervised analysis.
